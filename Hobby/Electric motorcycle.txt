RPM to KPH
You don't. RPM is revolutions per minute and not meters per minute, and not any distance per minute. A revolution per minute (rpm) is one full circle per minute ( 2 pi radians per minute or 360 degrees per minute )

Of course you can. RPM means the number of revolutions per minute. If you know the radius of the wheel than it's circumference is 2*Pi*r. If you know the diameter, the circumference is Pi*d. Imagine a tape measure along the rolling surface of the wheel. As the wheel turns, that tape is placed down on the street, one circumference worth of length per full rotation.
For example. if the diameter is 1 m (same as the radius being 1/2 meter) then per revolution you cover 3.14159 meters. If you were to go at 1000 rpm that translates into 3141.59 meters or 3.1 km per minute leaving you with a trailblazing 180 km/h. Catch me if you can.........
